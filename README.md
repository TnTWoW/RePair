## Overview

* Humans make multiple revisions when writing programs, while LLMs cannot receive feedback from compiler and test cases to optimize its repair policies automatically. We are exploring how to ensure small-scale LLM still outperform through process supervision and feedback.

* During training, we develop a reward model that serves as a critic, providing feedback for the fine-tuned LMâ€™s action, progressively optimizing its policy.

* During inference, we require the LM to generate solutions iteratively until the repair effect no longer improves or hits the maximum step limit.

## Installation

The code requires some dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`. Please follow the relevant libraries to install or run: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Datasets

We establish a multi-step program repair dataset based on CodeNet, which we call CodeNet4Repair. It include comprehensive test cases, problem descriptions, and detailed repair steps.

The dataset are available here:

## Usage

```python
python inference.py --model_id TnT/process-based-repair --dataset_name TnT/Multi_CodeNet4Repair
```
